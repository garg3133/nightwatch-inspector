## üîß Use in Other Projects (with a limitation)
This tool is not limited to Nightwatch.js and can be used in any project that needs CSS selectors. However, it comes with a limitation; you cannot test Nightwatch commands directly from the browser because it doesn't connected to the Nightwatch Server.

```js
import {crxfile} from 'nightwatch-selector-playground';
```
